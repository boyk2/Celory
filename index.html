            the other for helping others. Your “good old days” are still ahead of you, may you have many of them<br>

                into perspective and make you feel more positive about your own circumstances.

              <p class="image-description"> The dictionary defines charity in two ways: the voluntary giving of help to those in need 
                and kindness and
                 tolerance in judging others. Unfortunately, this is not how many people understand this word. A common misconception is
                  that charity is only for the
                  rich and you can’t be charitable if you’re 
                 barely getting by. But as has been proven by the likes of Mother Teresa, charity is not measured by how much you give.
                  Rather, it is the act of giving and 
                 the intent of the giver that truly matters. Besides, from the definition. </p>

              <p class="image-description">  Above, charity is not just about giving. It is also in how we treat others. Charity is in
                 how you make a stranger feel welcome, in how you make
                 others feel good about themselves, in how you help a disabled man cross the street
                 – it’s literally in everything we do. So wherever you are and whatever you do, practice charity as much as you can. And
                  don’t forget to inspire others to do the same too. If you
                  don’t know where to start,
                  using these charity quotes in your fundraising activities is a great way to get it going. </p>

                 a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his fingers through it once a day. For poise,
                  walk with the knowledge you’ll never walk alone. ... We leave you a tradition with a future. The tender loving care of human beings
                   will never become obsolete.  </p>
