CARE AND LOVE FOR US
I really don't understand why? Children live in a way that it's so miserable. It is known that life is about fighting and finding what we want, like money, basic needs and more luxurious life as how people want
But what about their life?
What about their care?
F.A.M.I.L.Y stands for Father and Mother I Love You. Where are they now? Parents are needed since are the organ in family foundation. Works, business and money has made them be far from the children. Parents, children need love and not properties, need health but not good food, need security but not bodyguard, need knowledge but not good schools and need care not house girls and house boys for their growth. Children need tips for their better way not a luxurious life. Your time is needed and teachings. "The behavior of a dog is the master's trainings"
A TRUE STORY
"There was a child, when she was young, she had no time with her parents, they were too busy. They did not give her tips about life and most of time stayed with a house girl. One day when the house girl was watching porn, the child saw her. Bad enough through the pictures and the videos of porn which the child was shown opened the door for the demon to enter in the child. These demons slept with the child most of the nights. This condition affected the child much. In searching for help she always went to the house girl since she was not used to her parents but the house girl always answered her, " You will grow up and do sex, so don't worry". This condition continued from Grade one till seven, still the demon came and sometimes he beats the child if she doesn't agree. Other days the child got pain on her genital parts after the man sleeping with her. At last the child got healed after entering in a Christian Secondary School "
Imagine if the child could not go in that school, what could happen?
Parents, ask yourself what happens when you are from your children?
When they will pass into difficulties will they manage to conquer them?
Also do you really trust the one you leave to take care of your children? Is he or she not a human that doesn't do wrong things?
If you really do not care of your children, why did you give birth to them? "How do you blame the pencil of not being sharp while you have not take responsibility of sharpening it?"
Parents, you are trusted by God and has given you the children to feed and protect them, if you lose, you will disappoint God. Know your responsibilities. Know that family needs home, love, peace, care not big house, house girls(babysitters), bodyguard and money
Parents reading this please change, be close to your sons and daughters make your children say, "I have a mom at home, I have a dad who I can express everything to him or her."
Parents of nowadays are not good friends at all this has made children to find their own parents for getting what they lack from their real parents . Children live alone with no guides, no teachings and no love. Love from parents is among basic needs.
Generation is crying, children perish evil ones conquer the good ones. This is because of the irresponsibility. 
Also in rearing parents should use wisdom in rearing the children. Unfairness and biasness should reduced if not abolished completely. All are children and all need both equal care. Unequal love always lead to destruction
Parents should rear the children until at last world becomes a better place. Unfaithful people increase because the foundation which is family is not built In a strong way.
We believe world can become a better place if everyone treats children well
