                         luxurious life. Your time is needed and teachings. "The behavior of a dog is the<br>
                         master's trainings" A TRUE STORY "There was a child, when she was young, she had<br>
                        no time with her parents,they were too busy. They did not give her tips about life<br>
                        and most of time stayed with a house girl. One day when the house girl was watching<br>
                           porn, the child saw her. Bad enough through the pictures and the videos of<br>
                            </p>
                        porn which the child was shown opened the door for the demon to enter in the child.<br>
                        These demons slept with the child most of the nights. This condition affected the <br>
                        child much. In searching for help she always went to the house girl since she was<br>
                        not used to her parents but the house girl always answered her, "You will grow<br>
                        up and do sex, so don't worry". This condition continued from Grade one till seven,<br>
                                              still the demon came and<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        sometimes he beats the child if she doesn't agree. Other days the child got pain on her<br>
                        genital parts after the man sleeping with her. At last the child got healed after entering<br>
                        in a Christian Secondary School " Imagine if the child could not go in that school, what <br>
                        could happen? Parents, ask yourself what happens when you are from your children? When they<br>
                        will pass into difficulties will they manage to conquer them? Also do you really trust<br>
                       the one you leave to take care of your children? Is he or she not a human that doesn't do <br>
                       wrong things? If you really do not care of your children, why did you give birth to them? <br>
                       "How do you blame the pencil of not being sharp while you have not take responsibility of<br>
                                  sharpening it?" Parents, you are trusted by God and has given you the <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        children to feed and protect them, if you lose, you will disappoint God. Know your responsibilities.<br>
                         Know that family needs home, love,peace, care not big house, house girls (babysitters) , bodyguard and<br>
                         money Parents reading this please change, be close to your sons and daughters make your children say,<br>
                         "I have a mom at home, I have a dad who I can express everything to him or her." Parents of nowadays<br>
                                are not good friends at all this has made children to find their own parents <br>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                         for getting what they lack from their real parents . Children live alone with no guides, no teachings and<br>
                         no love. Love from parents is,among basic needs. Generation is crying, children perish evil ones conquer<br>
                         the good ones.This is because of the irresponsibility.Also in rearing parents should use wisdom in rearing<br>
                         the children.Unfairness and biasness should reduced if not abolished completely.All are children and all need<br>
                         both equal care.Unequal love always lead to destruction Parents should rear the children until at<br>
                         last world becomes a better place. Unfaithful people increase because the foundation which is family is not built In<br>
                         a strong way.We believe world can become a better place if everyone treats children well.<br>
